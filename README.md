### \#whoami

I'm an electrical and computer systems engineer, biomedical engineer and physiologist from Australia.  I've been writing software since BASIC on my Commodore VIC-20 in the 1990s - I was in primary school.

Since university in the 2000s I've mostly been working on tools and systems to measure human performance in the clinical or resesearch environments.  This has largely been embedded software, data analysis and visualisation.  Initially this meant most of my work was in C, Objective-C, Matlab and Stata.  Furthermore, I was a publicly funded reseracher, so I published a lot of my tools and systems to the public domain (see my historical repos).

I've been an engineering leader and manager for the 5 - 10 years, and more of a focus on data analysis and visualisation.  This has meant Python, a lot of Python, and other people being on the tools.

Health and medicine are my industry, and I've worked in R&D, government regulation, policy and startup.  My technical focus has been on biomedical engineeering, electronics and software, physiology and cybersecurity in medicine and medtech.

### I'm currently working on
The last 10 years has been government and commerical work, so not visible in the public domain.  I currently apply software engineering across three commerical ventures:
* [Platypus MedTech Consulting](https://platypusmedtech.com.au) - Supporting medtech startups and SMEs with their engineering, quality management and regulatory affairs.  We have a particular specialty in software systems and digital health.
* [Biomedical Performance Technologies (BPT)](https://github.com/Biomedical-Performance-Technologies) - Instrumentation, measurement and data systems for motorsport, with a particular focus on integrating physioloigcal and biometric data.
* Method Quality - Software to help medtech startups and SMEs manage their risk and regulatory obligations.

### Ask me about
* Applying engineering, software and technology to medicine, sport and human performance.
* Risk management in medical technology.
* SDLC for medical technology.
* Quality management, including for software engineering and SDLC.
* Medical device regulatory requirements, inclduing Software as a Medical Device (SaMD).

### I'm currently learning
This never stops, but a lot of focus at the moment novel technolgies for wearable instrumentation and data analysis with sparse and patchy signals.

### Fun fact
Canberra does have kangaroos in our suburbs and around some of our workplaces.
